# kgraph

A simple (and vastly incomplete) graph library.

***Disclaimer:** The project is primarily used for practicing javascript and experimenting with different design patterns and coding styles. This is not intended as a complete graph-library.

## Current Features:

+ Creation of directed or undirected & weighted or unweighted graphs
+ 3 different path searches: Depth first search, Breadth first search & A* search
+ Some graph metrics: 
    * node distance
    * diameter
    * node degree
    * average node degree
    * order of the graph (node counts and edge counts)
